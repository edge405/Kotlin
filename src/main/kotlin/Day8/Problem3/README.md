Write a Kotlin program that finds the second largest number in a list of integers.

#### Requirements:
1. The program should read a list of integers from the user.
2. It should find the second largest number in the list.
3. If the list contains fewer than 2 distinct numbers, the program should print a message indicating that there aren't enough distinct numbers.

### Example:
```
Input: [10, 5, 20, 8, 20, 15]
Output: 15
```
Explanation: The largest number in the list is 20, and the second largest distinct number is 15.

#### Steps:
1. Read a list of integers from the user.
2. Find the second largest distinct number.
3. Print the second largest number or an appropriate message if there aren't enough distinct numbers.
