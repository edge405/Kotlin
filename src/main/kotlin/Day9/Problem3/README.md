Sure! Here's a simple problem for practicing Kotlin programming:

### Problem: Word Counter

#### Problem Description:
Write a Kotlin program that takes a sentence as input and counts the occurrences of each word in the sentence. The program should output each unique word in the sentence along with its frequency.

#### Example:
Input:
```
"This is a simple sentence. Another sentence is here."
```

Output:
```
Word: This, Frequency: 1
Word: is, Frequency: 2
Word: a, Frequency: 1
Word: simple, Frequency: 1
Word: sentence, Frequency: 2
Word: Another, Frequency: 1
Word: here, Frequency: 1
```

#### Requirements:
1. The program should be case-sensitive. For example, "This" and "this" should be considered as different words.
2. Punctuation marks should be ignored. For example, "sentence." and "sentence" should be counted as the same word.
3. The output should be sorted alphabetically by word.

#### Constraints:
- The input sentence will contain alphabetic characters, whitespace, and punctuation marks such as period (.), comma (,), exclamation mark (!), question mark (?), etc.

#### Note:
You can assume that the input sentence does not contain any leading or trailing whitespace.

This problem focuses on string manipulation, data structures (such as maps), and iteration in Kotlin. It's a good exercise to practice handling strings and collections in Kotlin.
