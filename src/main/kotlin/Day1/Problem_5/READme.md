## Problem: Bank Account Management
Create a class BankAccount in Kotlin to manage a simple bank account. Each account has an account number (String), balance (Double), and account holder name (String). Your class should support depositing money, withdrawing money, checking the balance, and displaying account details.

#### Requirements:
Data Class:

*BankAccountData(accountNumber: String, balance: Double, accountHolderName: String)*
Class: BankAccount

Methods:
* fun deposit(amount: Double): Adds the specified amount to the account balance.
* fun withdraw(amount: Double): Boolean: Subtracts the specified amount from the account balance. Returns true if the withdrawal is successful (balance >= amount), otherwise false.
* fun getBalance(): Double: Returns the current balance of the account.
* fun displayDetails(): String: Returns a string containing the account details formatted as "Account Number: XXXX, Holder: XXXX, Balance: $XXXX.XX".
