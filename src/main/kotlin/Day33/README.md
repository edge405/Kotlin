### Starting My Android Development Journey with Kotlin

Today, I’m taking a big step in my Android development journey using Kotlin. For the past 33 days, I’ve been diving into coding challenges to get a good grip on the language. While those challenges have been great for learning, I’ve realized it’s time to switch gears.

I want to start working on real projects and bring my ideas to life. It feels a bit scary, Moving from practice problems to actual projects will help me understand things better and see my progress in a more tangible way.
