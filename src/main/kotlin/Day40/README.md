**Problem: Palindrome Check**

Write a Kotlin function that checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

For example:
- `"madam"` is a palindrome.
- `"Racecar"` is a palindrome.
- `"hello"` is not a palindrome.

Your function should return `true` if the input string is a palindrome and `false` otherwise.
