### It's day 5 of learning kotlin, I haven't done anything this whole fucking day it's currently 8:30pm and I'm still solving a hashmap kotlin problems. Even though the syntax is more on concise or declarative approach, it's really hard to learn this language if you don't love reading, because you have to read the documentation of the functions that are not familiar in order to grasp the concept. Yeah It's hard but I still gonna learn this shit, no fucking EXCUSES!
