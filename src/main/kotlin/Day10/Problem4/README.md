Sure! Here's a problem for you to solve in Kotlin:

Problem:
Write a Kotlin program that takes a list of integers as input and returns the count of prime numbers in the list.

Constraints:
- You can assume that the input list will contain at most 1000 integers.
- Integers in the input list will be in the range from 2 to 10^6.

Your program should have a function with the following signature:
```kotlin
fun countPrimes(numbers: List<Int>): Int {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

Your function should return an integer representing the count of prime numbers in the input list.

Test your function with the following input:
```kotlin
val numbers = listOf(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 20, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 100)
println(countPrimes(numbers)) // Output should be 25
```

I'm just learning some lambdas here :))
