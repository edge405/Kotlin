#### Just wanna reflect something
It's just fucking really frustrating when you're trying so hard to stay consistent with something and it feels like it's just not working out. I've been practicing Kotlin coding for 18 days now, and I have to admit, it's been incredibly tough to stay on track every single day. Lately, for the past three days, I've been struggling with a serious lack of motivation and energy. It's like I've lost interest in everything, and I can't seem to find that spark to keep me optimistic about learning this language. It's really hard, and I feel so hopeless and miserable right now. I hate feeling like this, also there's no one who can help me find my way out of this maze so I have to help myself.. But how? 3 days is a lot of fucking time to procrastinate
